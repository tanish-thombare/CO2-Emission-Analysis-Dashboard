# CO2-Emission-Analysis-Dashboard

The increasing average atmospheric temperature has led to global warming, which drives a set of changes to the Earthâ€™s climate and weather systems. These swift changes are happening as humans continue to emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. Among these emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the critical anthropogenic greenhouse gas due to its abundance and its ability to remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years. Our analysis focuses on the identification of key trends and the main direct drivers that determine the changes in the quantity of CO2 emissions, both globally and for the five largest emitting countries and the European Union, as a whole. This gas currently, contribute a 72% to global total GHG emissions excluding land use, with F-gases accounting for the remaining 3%.
